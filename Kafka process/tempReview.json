It's run by crooks, thieves, and terrible people. They give zero care about human life or safety. Elevators get stuck and have issues non stop, and are FIVE YEARS PAST THEIR INSPECTION DATE. If you're in a wheelchair prepare to just not have access to your home at times. The repairs are slow and sloppy. Air condition units out for weeks on end (not unit, UNITS, because they have unsafe and outdated power delivery to the building, which blew out many residents units at once, in the winter.... Not even under heavy load), with zero ETA for fixes..... Why? Because they use student labor as a front for everything! Any complaint you make, any request you have, goes to an underpaid student, that gets no support for UCLA itself. The owners should be arrested or at the very least banned from building ownership ever again. This is unforgivable and I have no idea how they sleep at night, gouging students and staff day after day and can't even do BASIC ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.\n\nOh and the stairs are broken for months.

I told him that I was going to wait for one of the men that cut hair, either the guy next to him; or himself.

But no, I got skipped and there I go waiting again. He said that the guy next to him was going to take care of my haircut, but honestly at this point i'm impatient. Tired of waiting and after he finished the elderly man's haircut. He walked off and left, and at that point I was convinced that this \"business owner\" clearly is not about business and does not care about customer satisfaction or returning customers.

The website wanted candidates to upload their resume.  I called River City Staffing to find out if they were looking for a resume that they would use to screen me, or if they were looking for a resume that could be forwarded to employers.  The recruiter told me they were looking for a resume that contained my work history.  I got the recruiter's name and email address.\n\nI sent her a cover letter explaining that I'd been out of the corporate world for a number of years and I attached a paragraph style resume that highlighted my office skills, had my most pertinent info on the first page and my work history on the second page.\n\nThe recruiter replied via email that she hadn't read my resume because it was \"unclear\" and she was \"confused\" by the paragraph style.  She told me we could discuss employment opportunities only after I rewrote my resume to conform to a bullet style template which she sent as an attachment.\n\nI called the recruiter because I wasn't sure how to make my resume conform to the template.  The recruiter was very condescending when she explained that a resume \"must\" be bulleted and in chronological order.  I responded that my most pertinent work experience was not my most recent employment, and that I'd written my resume in a way that emphasized my most pertinent experience, but I did include my work history so she had a sense of the kinds of work I've done.   The recruiter insisted that I use her template.  I said I didn't think we'd be a good fit.\n\nIn the mean time, I landed a job with another agency using the resume rejected by River City Staffing.  When I asked the other recruiter if he would like me to revise my resume, he said my resume was fine.

The owner responded to a diffrent review saying, \"some things are out of our control\" pertaining to Vehicles being broken into. My car was broken into the third day I moved in and just so happens it's not underneath the camera, so the renter's insurance policy won't cover it. There's two cameras over the jacuzzi at Stonegate watching every person that gets in and out of that jacuzzi. If those two cameras were over the parking lots perhaps it be a safer place perhaps you would be able to control the criminal activity and make it a safer place.\n\nThere are bugs everywhere in this place, so infested and you know why because they have Dewey Pest Control. This is the worst and cheapest Pest Control you can possibly have.\n\nI was leased an apartment, but prior I was given a visual floor plan that has more square footage than the actual unit I got. There was no frigerator the dishwasher was broken the stove top exhaust doesn't work.\n\nThe first thing I did was put in a work order for the broken step leading up to my apartment to be fixed and they never did it. Maintenance told me that they needed to get a hold of corporate to be approved to spend that sort of money. The safety of the residents and their belongings are not of any concern to the owner of this place. Months now have passed and a few weeks back I was told corporate cleared a check to fix the stair, but it's still broken 5 months down the road.\n\nIt's clear to me that the staff of this complex have their hands tied and they really do try and acomidate all 160 residents request. Jeffrey Miller and the shareholders of Pacific Living Places are raking in profits and not providing the maintenece or office workers with the tools required to operate a safe livable place for people.\n\nThe security cameras are operated by one IT dude whom is contracted not to share any video footage with residence. I found this out becuase this time my work truck was broken into and it was right in the cameras line of sight. He, nor the staff here was willing to show me the footage, so I could share it with police in hopes of getting my tools back. Sadly the esurance renters insurance required for each resident to have in order to stay here won't even pay out the policy with the theft happening on camera. Miller insurance a provider of rental insurance started by family of CEO of PLP Jeff Miller are incauhuts bambosaling tenats for as much money as they can stuff in their hollow hearts.\n\nThe security working on Friday thrue Sunday night rides a motercycle around the complex with no helmet or company identification on himself, setting of car alarms. The security number provided by the complex is a scam. They don't dispatch anyone in the time of need or crime reported. I called many times and their soul purpose is to alert the office that a report was made to them. Then I reported to the office and they to,d me to report to the number that actually just reports back to the office.\n\nThe insurance company has not responded to my email in a week about my work truck being broken into. I will add to this review as the time passes and I find out more.\n\nAugust 18th of 2018 its been several months scince I have vacated the facility. I paid out all the closing cost and wished everything to be done in the earlier days of June 2018. I have talked with Mary(white) Vanessa(Latina) Robin(African-American) almost on a wekley basis trying to get my security deposit back. I think that this is a problem that is surley in the each of your hands as much as it is in Jeffery Millers hands.

Please let us address both of your issues:\n\nIn regards to our \u201cvariety of sandals hav[ing] gone downhill,\u201d please consider the following:\na)\tWe, as a society, are now three months into the crippling COVID-19 pandemic.\nb)\tThis pandemic first hit China, where nearly all of the footwear (including the sandals you buy) is manufactured.\nc)\tAs such, supply chains were cut off for months.\nd)\tIn addition, most footwear stores were deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d and closed for 2 months or longer.\ne)\tIn response, our supplier slashed retail prices to call it quits on their summer line (right as spring started), and we responded by doing the same.\nf)\tBeing that we were one of the only stores that carry the product that was allowed to open our doors, our product has been picked over, with no incentive from the supplier to replenish inventory at cut-rate margins.\ng)\tVionic, in particular, has moved away from large varieties of sandals, and has focused their growth on their more fashion-forward products, including boots and dress shoes.\nh)\tWe cannot stock more than what Vionic manufactures.\ni)\tThis portion of your review can be summarily dismissed, as it is very much a reflection of the current state of the world and the manufacturing choices of our supplier.\n\nIn regards to the brace that you were unable to return, please consider the following:\na)\tYou purchased the brace yesterday at 1:01PM and called to inquire about returning it at 2:46PM.\nb)\tThe item you purchased is meant for overnight use while sleeping.\nc)\tIt is not uncommon for any new brace or orthopedic device to cause discomfort when first being used, as you and your body acclimate to the product.\nd)\tWe clearly indicate that, for health and hygiene purposes (which are heighted amid the COVID-19 pandemic), all products at this time are non-returnable.\ne)\tAdditionally, we will not take immediate returns on any item meant to be used overnight, and before any period of acclimation has been allowed.\nf)\tHowever, we are very much willing to work with any and all customers to help in fitting, application, etc.\ng)\tThis portion of your review can also be dismissed by the simple fact that you wrote it within hours of purchasing an item that is supposed to be worn overnight, and can take several days to acclimate to.\n\nWe hope to be able to continue to help you as you endeavor to relieve your foot pain.

I did it for my growing family. Anyways, I didn't want to spend too much on this vehicle since it's not very important to me other than to be reliable and safe.  To make it alittle more comfortable for my kids and myself, I wanted to tint the windows for a good price. Don't get me wrong, the expensive ones do a great job. When I contacted Boris and we talked about what I wanted and got a price qoute, I was shocked. Sometimes you get a price too good to be true, WELL in this case it's true. I was expecting a guy doing window tinting in his home or run down place. Boris is actually very skilled and very focused. He did 9 windows total in roughly 2hrs with small talks and breaks. I respect him and love to do business with hard working skilled people. He's honest and hard working. No BS and gets all of the business because of his very very very affordable price. I'm actually glad I found him and I will continue to do business with him as long as he's still tinting. The brand he uses seems to be reputable and not generic. I did alittle research on it while I was waiting. He also does higher end products like ceramic tints( Suntek and 3M) it rejects heat alot better. I will be referring him to my friends and family from now on.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x808561e421dd80ab:0x14c398c7bd01b0d6"}

He laid out my cards and then gave me my reading. After about a 10 minute reading he gave me some concerning feedback and said I needed to be cleansed of all the negativity. He didn't explain what each card meant he just gave me his interpretation of things and it was serious matters. He said his cleansing would cost $390 for 10 minutes. RIP OFF!! I ended up going to House of Intuition a few days later to get a second reading and spiritual healing. I paid $90 for 1 hour of tarot reading and shamanic healing. The tarot cards revealed the same information however the interpretation was completely different. I got my chakras aligned and found out that I have a calling of healer. The botanical guy had distorted the interpretation of my cards so that he could dwindle me out of $400!! All I can say is that karma will return to him x3.

Today she went in to purchase and she was priced $75! There was a second wheelchair in better condition so she asked about that one and was priced $85. The lady told my mom that she didn't care what they had told her the past days, the wheelchair was $75. After I got there the lady didn't speak to me, she just looked me up and down. While my mom and I were talking trying to figure out if this is the wheelchair we wanted to purchase I kept feeling uneasy because she kept passing by us but not really with a purpose. We decided to purchase and got in line, still talking about how happy the lady we were donating it to would be. I was skeptic on the price as we went in with an idea and was priced different but whatever, sometimes co-workers get prices wrong. We decided we were gonna talk with the cashier and ask if that price was the least, we weren't too hopeful as the lady had already rudely told us the price was $85, \"because the cushion alone is $180\". We didn't care too much for the cushion, but we figured it was nice discount and slightly worn.\n\nEverything was going semi-good when she came around the building and yelled, from the door, (!!!YELLED!!!) at the cashier, that the wheelchair is $85. He wasn't even finished with his current customer yet. My mother is kind and hates conflict, bless her soul. But this lady's tone of voice when directed at us or about us was rude and as if she felt we were stealing or something. She yelled it loud as if to let everyone know we were there, buying a wheelchair???\nI don't want to point to racism here, I've had very few encounters with racism as I am Mexican but speak perfect English. But there's no other way to explain the tone of voice she used at us. The looks she gave us, or that she yelled at the cashier as if to say \"I'm sure they will try to haggle but that item is $85 so I'm gonna tell so everyone is aware\".\n\nNow I love this store, don't get me wrong sometimes they have beautiful items. But this lady made me have a sour taste whenever I think of this store now. Very very disappointed. We took our business elsewhere and found what we were looking for. \ud83d\udc4e", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8084388b28128d97:0x9adc74426cb1e923"}

One of the workers (perhaps the owner?) promptly called to see where the tech was. He gave me a quick update and even bought me a drink from shop's convenience store. His friendly demeanor and attentiveness helped turn things around. The tech arrived within 20 minutes and my car was taken care of within 10 minutes. Surprisingly, the smog check was completed a lot quicker than other shops I've been to.

Beware very long review long story short was over charged and got run around when I confronted them about charge. Keep a close eye if you pay with credit card. I had a guy tech and he kept pushing for me to \"get gel polish \" after saying no for the 3rd time he started to mimick me by saying no. By the time he finished my nails he told me to sit by the drying station I noticed that my nails where bubbling so I talked to the receptionist and she said to talk to \"him\". He came And pretend to act surprise. He said he would fix but that i would have to wait. So 3 min later he takes some acetone and rubbs the clear coat off with his finger. He proceeds to apply a thicker cost of polish plus clear coat and walks me to drying station as to make sure I didn't do whatever I did to cause the nail polish to bubble. So as my nails are drying they start to bubble AGAIN I inform him and he comes and looks at my nails and pretends that only one has bubbles so I correct him and tell him that no that all of them are bubbling. Again he tells me that I have to wait for 5 min so this time he roughly unpolished my nails and actually took his time and polished my nail correctly. By the time my nails dried I was happy finally no bubbles!  Here comes the real shocker I went on Saturday so on Monday I am looking over my bank account and noticed that I have a  charge of $109.00 from Phantastic Nails!  So I went to nail shop asking to speak to a manager or person in charge I was told to take a seat and wait for 10 min. I told her that I was not going to wait for 10 min that if there was someone in charge or not. She stopped what she was doing and asked what the problem was. I told her of the charge and she said that it was a mistake that the guy had charge my account by mistake........ So I lost my cool and got a bit loud. She said plead wait let me get my manager on the phone. She called some one and spoke in her native tongue then handed me the phone. So this lady said it was a mistake and that they refunded my money back I told her that one as not seeing any refund and that if it was a mistake why was I not informed. Again I was told to wait that she was going to call the guy in charge of their credit card machine. So this guy starts telling me that the refund was issued to give it 3 days and I would see the refund. If not to call him and that \" we could work something out\". So I'm so done by this point I tell him that I will be contacting my bank to inform of the fraudulent charge. He said that I could do that but that they had paper work and that they would re charge my credit card. So I asked what paperwork you have no signature on receipt for 109.00 dollar charge. I never authorized that charge. We be talking to my bank tomorrow as it was closed by the time I left nail shop.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80d953c0d67f5785:0x9018208e3e55bf7b"}

They started work Monday morning early, the team outside, with preparation for the installation of the helical piles.  They worked fast and efficiently.  When Tuesday came around they started working on the inside fixes.  By Wednesday afternoon they had finished both shoring up the house  on the outside and grinding/ repairing all the cracks on the inside.   The whole team was competent and efficient.  Special shout out to Andrew the site manager,  and Jack the grinder and Crack repair guy.   Both were obviously good at their jobs and made us feel like we could trust them with our home.

We were also concerned about some off center posts and small cracks in the concrete the home inspector showed us.\n\nWe scheduled an appointment and Kyle showed up right on time. He explained the process and said he'd need about an hour to take some measurements, use a level to see if there was any sinking, and to go underneath the house to check the crawlspace. He mentioned that he'd provide an honest assessment when he was done.\n\nTo our astonishment, once Kyle was done, he said there were no real concerns to note, so our house was provided a clean bill of foundation health! He even explained how the terrain we live on has helped keep the house very level since it's not on a clay bed.\n\nKyle was true to his word. Class act that is harder to find these days.

In a nutshell, Swan is very professional, hygienic with equipment and process, attentive to detail, and incredibly talented, and so nice.

My face felt the same as it did before the procedure.

However, when we were chit-chatting while he was marking my brows the subject of God came up and he asked if I believed God was a healer. I responded that I was an atheist and his whole demeanor changed. All of a sudden he was going to have his scheduler be in touch (he didn't mention a scheduler when I scheduled this appt). I said, \"Wait, aren't you going to tattoo me today?\" He said on the phone that this appointment would be 3 hours and even said early in the appointment that after today about 50% of the color would peel off so I fully believe the intent was to tattoo me today. He now said that this was a consultation and that I should get a couple more consults - \"in fact, I highly recommend that you check out at least 2 others and see how you feel about them\". He was giving me the bum's rush even though there was nobody else there. He even walked out and walked over to another part of the salon before I was done calling my ride. He did come back to ask if I wanted a water while I wait for my ride.\n\nI was really disappointed with the whole situation as he CLEARLY no longer wanted to do my brows because of my religious beliefs. I believe he has every right to choose his customers however he wishes, but my religion or lack thereof has nothing to do with how good of a customer I am.

Since it came with an alarm and had no way to set the alarm.. so I changed my review from 4/5 to 1/5.. also that navy fed check you get for a car can also be used as a down payment for many other cars remember that.. you always have a choice in everything.. plus they like to call and see how much you qualify with Navy Fed and then tell you the car choices you can get based off that check and the actual car you want that they advertised and then most dealerships pay for your fees here they charge you when it comes in cause they don\u2019t send the plates to your address.. Overall wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone come here.. never have..", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80dc742efd23ae27:0x94afbc015ffd9ee4"}

He explained that he too used to have quite a collection of old / vintage newspapers and other historical items so I immediately knew I came to the right place. Allan was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable and even provided a discount for the work. I was so pleased with the experience I brought in a few more posters and items to have framed by them.\n\nPRO TIP: mention the deal on Yelp. Some of the employees won't immediately offer (or even know about it), so be sure to mention it.\n\nI'm beyond happy with the quality of the work.\nI'm also glad to see they are taking every precaution necessary to make sure the employees and customers are safe. Everyone needs to wear a mask, they provide gloves, hand sanitizers, limit the number of customers in the store at any given time, etc. They are now even doing contact tracing.\n\nA+ for your incredible service, Allan & team.

They needed chaperoning\nEg: When asked to clean the refrigerator, they only cleaned the lower section and left the top part as is. I expected them to clean the oven (included as part of the the kitchen) but they weren't able to get to it in 1.5 hours.\nThey didn't bother vacuuming under a rug and I had to ask them to.\n\n2. They definitely need to work on the speed at which they work - I did not want to micro manage but looks like that is needed. Customers expect less chit chat and more work when we're paying $120/hr.\nThey were able to clean 2 baths, 1 kitchen and dusted of the living room in 1.5 hours (3 women).\n\n3.

The place is great but be prepared for a ridiculous rent increase at the end of your term. That is why we are moving out.

They are very nice And friendly people here and know what they are doing. Hopefully I don\u2019t have to visit again.But if I need major dental work done again I will definitely have no problem going back.

I was initially attracted by two things . The first was the Move-In special that seemed convenient given the medium-high price of the apartments and the second one was the vicinity of the freeway. However my move in was in a rush because I was visiting family in Europe and also switching between two jobs from SD to OC.   I didn't consider enough elements before making my decision.\n\nA. URBAN AREA : Too close to the freeway and the train: from several spots of the building or from my apartment with the window open you could hear the background noise and when the train passes part of the building shakes.\n\nB. NEIGHBORHOOD isn't awesome. I've seen various times homeless people being reckless and police stopping them. Walking around isn't great as it's just a big intersection between crown-vallwy, the train and the freeway. You don't really wanna walk to any malls from there. Sometimes strangers/ non residents try to get into the complex using various excuses. It didn't feel very safe. For a while there has been open a very loud bar in front of it , I  witnessed resident who were trying to sleep at night shouting at the bar customers and starting \"fights\". Now that bar is closed.\n\nC. NIGHT TIME: Several times during the year the fire alarm (so loud) started ringing in the middle of the night and everyone had to go in the street. One night it happened twice. Management said it was sometimes because of tenants burning food in the oven, sometimes smoking , or sometimes just a malfunction. Fire brigades came all the times and all the times management said that was not going to happen again. It happened several times so who knows...\nIt also happened around 5 times , days and nights, that some neighbor rang our doorbell and ran. Whether it was a prank or a mistake the doorbells are so loud that you'd wake up if you are sleeping. So annoying.\n\nD.  AMENITIES: are good and new, but the complex is big and they can get crowded, especially on weekends.\n\nE: SERVICE and PARKING: management is quick making repairs and very quick to charge you as well. In general they have always been responsive.\n\nParking is somewhat ok.They once double assigned one of my paid parking spots to another tenant and had me park in the guest space for few weeks. Many other residents just consistently park in the guest spaces, every night I suppose without paying. I never witnessed actions to enforce the rules, but a few emails.\n\nMy impression is that they try to fix problems but the community is very big and many residents seemed to not respect the rules and thus it looks like the management is always running after something or someone.\n\nF. DEPOSIT: We left the apartment clean, as clean as I found it. Normal wear and tear barely noticeable or unnoticeable. I spent an afternoon cleaning and they still charged us for the whole deposit amount.\n\nNot a tragic experience all in all but definitely not very pleasant. I have lived in better places with lower rent.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1593561066948, "text": "Stefano, we regret to hear that your experience with us was not a more positive one.

He is an excellent Dr with a great bed side manner and truly caring and compassionate Dr. I've now been treated by Dr. Untal, Levitan, Woods & Pirouz. Dr Woods, while very skilled & knowledgeable, was the only one that I did not connect with at all.\nDr Levitan is my treating surgeon has been very easy to work with and extremely caring. He had provided medications, referrals & epidural injection's for me. Recently he implanted a medtronics spinal cord stimulator in my lumbar spine. This has given me huge relief of sciatic pain and lumbra neuropathy. I'm scheduled for a cervical epidural again in 5 days, and while the surgery center can be quite busy, he and his staff are caring, comasionate and dedicated to whole patient care. I could not rate him highly enough.\nI have also been a patient of Dr Untal and treated by Dr Patel who both have excellent beside manner. The nurses and techs in the surgery center have a stressful job and are usually extremely busy. They are often overworked as getting people out of pain or treating the pain is their priority so the schedule can be over-filled due to emergency procedures. I've waited 2 hours past appointed time and been seen immediately.\nPatients like me, who are in intense pain or chronic severe pain, are often short, curt, rude and can be disrespectful. The Dr's nurses and staff have still remained calm, cool and collected.\nCandy & Connie at check in work long tiring days and yet they too know that the goal is to treat everyone fairly.\nIn my opinion most people that have low rating of pain management specialists is due to the wait times they have experienced and not the quality of care.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80ecc29171092fa5:0xc579a87dc548e977"}

I've been to a lot of general purpose gyms, and I've been trying out a bunch of different classes for years (from tae kwon do, judo, ice skating, yoga, kendo...) to hopefully find the one sport for me. On top of that, I also needed to be in a place where I felt comfortable.\n\nThe folks at UFC are nice, but chill. It's not the kind of vibe you feel at places like Crunch, where everyone seems to be almost manically cheerful and YEAHHHH FITNESS!!! The overall feeling here is, \"Hey, how's it going? Gonna punch things? Cool, we'll be here if you need anything. We'll also play some jams.\"\n\nIf you like classes and have the discipline to go every day or every other day, you'll get super tired, but will probably be super fit. I'd been going consistently for about six months, tried out personal training, and I actually have muscle in my normally noodle-arms that's noticeable. They are TONED, yo. There's also a decent selection of weights and treadmills if that's your jam, but I mean, personally, it's all about the punching bags.\n\nI started off month-to-month, and loved it so much that I went for the full year. I've just renewed my membership, and now that I live closer, I can go more often!

We had opted out of treating because he was semi-feral and did not take to us sticking tubes down his throat every day.  Instead, we tried to make his life as easy as possible and when he got picky with his food, my mom fed him people food.  However, after a couple of years of this, we got the feeling the end was near as food (even people food) become unappetizing.  We had heard of services which would come to you so you could say goodbye to your pet at home where he/she is most comfortable.  One of the volunteers at Kitten Rescue recommended Choice Veterinary Care.  We had called another place recommended by another vet but Choice seemed to be more informed and knowledgeable.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for the vets at Choice.  We spoke to Dr. Amy at first to discuss our situation and she made us feel comfortable with our choice.  Because the team at Choice are all vets, they all know about the various illnesses afflicting the cats and were very helpful explaining our cat's behavior.  We have known for a while that our cat was not going to get better and we wanted to make sure he had gotten the most quality life possible w/ the least amount of suffering.\n\nDr. Peter was assigned to us and he was incredible patient...he explained again how our cat's illness had progressed and made us feel comfortable with our situation.  He explained the whole process of how the euthanasia would work.  When the time came to say goodbye, he was so gentle with our cat.  A week after the euthanasia, a member of the Choice Team dropped off our cat's ashes in person.\n\nThere is really no easy way to say goodbye to a loved family member but we felt so supported by Choice.  Our goal was to have our family cat suffer the least amount possible and taking him to a vet would have been too cruel and stressful for him.  By the end, our family cat really had the best relationship with my mom so it was hardest for her.  She was just so incredibly grateful for the care provided by Dr. Peter.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80c2b72167ea6b5f:0xf7afeb4cae91e6"}

Let me start by letting you know the REALITY of what your experience might be like if you visit this office. WARNING do not take your children here! Most of the reviewers have one review which most likely means this office asked them to do a review remember that when yelping or googling places. The more reviews you make the most likely Yelp or google will keep your reviews. Our good friend is a dentist however, unfortunately does not work on children. He referred us to this dentist thinking he was an upstanding dentist who would treat us well and give my daughter a great experience. Our first impression with the doctor was good. He was nice so was his staff. The problem came once the exam was done they told us the insurance didn\u2019t cover this and that. Which was a lie. Spoke to insurance myself and they stated the office was wrong. I also do dental billing so I knew they were wrong but wanted a verbal confirmation from the insurance. I took her to get a second opinion at Dr.Fishman\u2019s office in Downey. Now this office was 100 percent honest. Told me they would never do the treatment that Dr.Nasibi at Montebello children\u2019s dentistry recommended on a child. They said it was \u201caggressive\u201d and there was no need for it some were put on \u201cwatch\u201d meaning the dentist would keep an eye on them but she did not feel so much treatment was needed. He had recommended baby root canal baby crowns filling over 1000 dollars worth of treatment. Left Dr.Fishman\u2019s office with her cleaning done and two fillings done have had no problems since. This was a while back. What reminded me was recently spoke to our dentist who is our personal friend and he stated to me that he spoke to Dr.Nasibi and he stated \u201cthey don\u2019t know\u201d. We may have not gone to dental school however, my dental background is what made me question his diagnosis and I was right!! Imagine those parents who just want to do what is best for their children and get lied to or pressured into doing something their child doesn\u2019t need. This doctor should be ashamed of himself doing this to children. Do not go here do your research before trusting someone with your children. They do not let you in the room so who knows what gets said or done to your kids as well.

The guys spent all day rodent proofing, then they cleaned, sanitized, repelled and set traps. They'll be back to check the traps and the work is warrantied.

They have some tasty-sounding sandwiches on their menu which we might try next time.\n\nThey have somewhat unusual hours for boba because the location is in an medical office building - at the time of this review they close daily at 3p and aren't open on the weekend (edit: right after I posted this I saw that they are open on some Saturdays this holiday season). Also note that it is on a one way street that is effectively an El Camino frontage road. We got there around 1:30p on a rainy Wednesday and there was no line. The building does have a parking garage but I didn't look to see if it is controlled or not. We were able to find parking on the street right out front without any trouble.\n\nI would probably rate them a 4+ - my palate for tea is not that discriminating so it might not be possible for a boba place to distinguish itself enough to get a 5 from me based on quality alone. But with the favorable prices, the very friendly staff, and our hope for the success of this independent local business, I'll give them the benefit of the extra partial star.

An update, a vessel number, a container ID, anything would have been reassuring.\n\nA big issue for me at the destination was that the movers contracted by SDC packed my already disassembled furniture (Ikea, mostly) by size of pieces, instead of by furniture item.

The problem was that the receipt states \"Tracking unavailable to this destination country\" even though I paid the additional 16 dollars for the Registered option on my First-Class Package International Service to Spain. (I presume the discrepancy is caused by the COVID-19 crisis that is present as I write this review.) Nevertheless, I also had ready on my smartphone the USPS Tracking webpage for this package. When I asked the man how I could verify the delivery of this package -- considering that I paid for the tracking service -- he said that the information is online. When I proceeded to say that I did check online but didn't see any information, he loudly interjected, \"No!\" as he circled the customs form number (tracking number) printed on my receipt. I then showed him on my phone the freshly loaded USPS Tracking webpage that stated, \"Not Trackable - USPS Tracking\u00ae is unavailable for this product for SPAIN.\" He became frustrated and questioned if I had typed the tracking number correctly, and then I informed him that I actually copy-pasted it directly from the electronic USPS receipt that I had elected to receive via email, in addition to the paper receipt. He then said, \"I don't know what's wrong with your system, but I see it tracking on my end.\" I informed him that I simply purchased the service on the previous day at the retail counter in very next room of this building, and this is the only information I received. He angrily went to the backroom for about 30 seconds and then came back with a printout of the package's status reported by Product Tracking & Reporting (a system in the USPS Tracking Intranet). I was content with these printouts and took them for my reference (after all, the recipient of my package deserves some evidence of progress in case of a query). Finally, I thanked the man and exited the post office. I don't understand why this had to be difficult; I don't believe I deserved his negative attitude when all I did was ask politely about the tracking information that was absent in my only available sources.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6EmiME90ZVhp_jWdu5AHpCeJbh3Z-7CB9qLBr=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80c2c0dbe29504df:0x818de4dad615d536"}

Maybe she was just having a bad day - everyone does - but my Rite Aid ice cream counter at my home store (Pleasant Hill, ca) has very friendly employees who get excited at my ice cream excitement.\n\nThe ice cream was amazing - as expected. I even tried a new flavor: Black Cherry, and my favorite: Mint Chip. Sorry Cookies N Cream - I cheated on you today. Scoops of ice cream for less than $2 each is still the best price anywhere - and their ice cream is consistent and awesome.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x808430a0a911770d:0xa9b089ea00200634"}

Did you know that Scarantinos is a family-operated restaurant that uses Sicilian recipes handed down from the previous generation? In fact, many of the recipes were created by Grandma Scarantino over 50 years ago and remain unchanged.\n\nThe restaurant is split in half. On the right, there is a tablecloth setting in a casual atmosphere. Lighting is a bit dim. On the left side, a mini sports bar is found. There are 8 large screen TVs screening ESPN and Fox Sports, sometimes with games featuring local teams. The contrast in the two sides of the restaurant is striking, as a semi-intimate dining area is connected to the rowdy sports bar equipped with a jukebox.\n\nThe sports bar area is a bit divey. I came for a late lunch and groups of regulars lounged around with beers, chatting with the hostess, seemingly not having to go back to work. On the other hand, I was there anticipating a quick in-and-out lunch and even rushing my order, so I was an outlier.\n\nWhat makes Scarantino stand out is their affordable $6.95 lunch special. It includes a generous basket of garlic toast and sourdough bread, soup or house salad, and a lunch portion pasta. The pasta is customizable although choices are basic. Meat or seafood toppings requires an additional fee. For the pasta, you can choose between angel hair, linguine, penne, and fettuccini. You also get to select a sauce between spicy marinara, marinara, pomodoro, and alfredo.\n\nI ordered the linguine with spicy marinara sauce. Very rich tomato sauce with a fair amount of heat, texture was not creamy, taste was not overly sweet. Wouldn't mind having it again although I want to try their pomodoro sauce next time. Despite not having meat in the lunch, I left fairly full, probably because I ate the entire basket of garlic bread, which is one of the best I've had.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80dce8f179fcb781:0x6bed690d92392f3a"}

When I saw Matt hours later my vehicle had not even been touched and he blamed others for not doing proper scheduling when Matt did the schedule with me face to face over a week prior. I arrive back later still with no communication to see a large scratch on my vehicle and I point it out before I even touch my key fob. He told me it came like that and walked away. I know this is not true since the vehicle is brand new and was PDI last week. I go to the office to talk to him more about the scratch and that the wrap is scratched up and marred. He tells me \u201clet it be in the sun and it will smooth out\u201d and I then say how is the other side perfectly smooth in the shade? He says to give it time. I now realize there is truth in the negative comment on here and Yelp. I wish I read reviews before I had them do any work.\n\nWithin hours I received a reply from this business after my review was published.

The car had multiple scratches on both sides, far from being a \u201c brand new immaculate car\u201d . As soon as he comes to pick it up he immediately walks right up to the car and blames us for scratching the car.\n\nNow , if the customer would of acted like a civil adult , I could of easily polished out the scratches for him free of charge.

Couldn't fix it right away and then forgot to try again later.  At any rate, Alex was welcoming, the salon was clean and updated, and comfortable.  Love that you've got complementary wine!  Not gonna lie, I'm still getting used to my new hair cut.  I have very curly hair that I've been growing out for about a year, and wanted my new cut to look great both curly and straight.  Initial cut was a bit of a shock, length wise the reality is shorter than I expected, but it's not fair to make a complete judgement about the cut until I sit with it for a little while.  I left the salon with bone straight hair so still need to check it out curly before knowing how I really feel about it.  Looking forward to playing around with it some to see how I really feel.

I was just trying to find out if I could fill my propane tanks at this facility. I had been there many times before since it is 2 minutes from my home. But,  did not want to load 6 tanks onto my truck if their filling station was not working. Finally someone answered. A answering service. Darn! No direct line to the actual store!\nFortunately the person on the phone was super nice and helpful. She even called the direct line to the store but also got NO RESPONSE!  So I thanked her and went ahead and took a chance a loaded up my tanks.\nI arrived in 2 minutes and pulled up to the filling area. They have a button you push to get someone inside to come out.\nSomeone came out within a minute.\nThis employee was very nice. She immediately began taking pics of each tank which is required to document that they are not outdated.\nI unloaded and she filled each one and I reloaded back onto to the truck. Quick, fast and easy!\nYou can pay right there with your credit or ATM card. You pay by the total gallons that were filled and they fill them full. 3.29 a gallon. That's cheap!\nI previously took my not totally empty tanks to Lowes or AMPM and switched for a full tank to be sure I had full ones for a special occasion and didnt want to run out.  Normally this cost is 20 dollars each.\n6 tanks switched would have been $120.\nThis total cost was around $46. Great savings!\nI've been to this place several times before.\nEach time their employees have been professional,  knowledgeable and friendly.\nThe communications need to improve.\nMost persons that didnt know what was available ( like filling of propane tanks) at their facility would not wait on the phone for 39 minutes to find out. They would search elsewhere for what they need. I'm sure they have have lost business due to this fact.\nSo a improvement in this area would be a asset.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80dc83664478ae47:0xcfe647f7a0765972"}

During this time, I was charged a late fee (for one month: this was before coronavirus circumstances. During coronavirus no late fees were collected) plus a $50 lien on my storage unit. That would have been fair if I simply wasn't paying my rent, but the fact that this was charged regardless of the fact that it was a technical error on their part was not acceptable. They only credited the amount to my account after I complained about it. I shouldn't have had to do that.\n\nThen there was this fun little set of facts:\n\nIf you have a padlock other than their own: They'll cut your lock and charge YOU $50 for a replacement.\n\nIf you don't want to buy their lock because you're moving out at the end of the month, that's a problem. You're not allowed to leave your unit unlocked or they'll put a lock on the door and charge you $50 for it.\n\nIf your storage room is empty, you STILL have to lock it. With THEIR padlock. Otherwise they'll charge you $50.\n\nFinally, when it's time to move out, you won't get a prorated refund if you're moving out any day other than the day your rent is due.\n\nSo even though I want to keep ownership of the unit until the end of the month in case I need it for a day or two when my movers arrive (after all, I've paid for it), I can't do that unless I lock it... With their lock.\n\nUpdate 7/15:\nI don't see what right they have to lock my belongings so I can't get them when I've paid all my rent.

There was a lot of breading (or whatever they use for it) which made it taste a little off to me.\n\nOverall, if I'm in Redwood city and looking for Chinese food to satisfy a craving, this place will do, but I won't go out of my way to eat here.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x808fa2457dc2bb07:0x38710a040751b559"}

I felt no pressure to buy the car or trade mine in. Zero pressure what so ever,  a very welcome change from experiences I've had in the past, especially considering the reputation of Folton Ave dealers. Ryan, Jake and Peter are definitely doing their best to change that reputation one customer at a time. Not only did they be super cool with me testing driving with no immediate intention to buy but they did it twice and were very patient with me after I harassed them with questions I had after the pre purchase inspection revealed some potential issues. After talking to numerous techs about the inspection result I felt good that the car was okay to buy but I later found that the 12 volt power nor the cigarette lighter worked. My bad for assuming someone at some point tested the accessory power, simple enough to fix with a replacement fuse though. Still they gave me what I wanted for my trade in but didn't install the floor mats nor remove the plastic from the floors  but my wife and I were on a tight timeline so that may have been a contributor. Minor issues in the grand scheme of things though. All and all I'm walking away feeling really good about the experience. Definitely recommend checking them out and paying attention to the review scores as not all Fulton dealers are full of con men.", "pics": null, "resp": {"time": 1619767009267, "text": "Thank you for the 5-stars, Dave!

I want to do laundry.  What else would I want in a laundromat?\" And he says, \"We close at 11pm and I don't want to wait for you!\" and I said, \"Well it's 10pm and I only have a tiny load of laundry. It will be done by 11pm.\" Then he yells at me to get out of his establishment.  WTF. You lost a customer Mr.  Rude owner! The laundry business isn't about laundry.

They told me I wouldn\u2019t be billed unless I had a procedure performed. I agreed. I asked if they\u2019ll let me know what counts as a procedure and they said yes. Two months later I get a bill for $500! Just for a cotton swab ($17) and a bloodpressure check ($8) but they charged addition hundreds of dollars for the VISIT.

I had apparently neglected to specify that and noticed that they had given me 5 skrawny , over cooked  chicken wings. While still at the counter I pointed out that there was a mistake and the lady rudely ignored me then pretended that she didn't understand English until another customer came in.  Since they don't let you review the order or give you a receipt, she eventually pulled up the order and pointed out that was what she entered albeit not what I wanted.  In my experience, businesses taking an order  provide options in order to clarify or help the customer with their decision if their request is initially vague.  They refused to exchange the order, which had not left the counter, refund me my money when I said I didn't want food I didn't order, and then told me I could place another order with the correct selection but would have to pay full price in addition to the order I didn't order nor want.   So to my disappointment, I got to pay for anorexic chicken wings I didn't want,  horrible customer service that rudely refused to come to a reasonable solution, and an overall really bad experience.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x808f7ee25eed13ef:0x7ad573b0e135a070"}

We're pretty modest people, and aren't well versed in jewelry, so as my wife took the reigns, I trusted her to find an appropriate spot.

Always welcoming and service oriented without being over the top. When we finished and picked up the ring, they broke out a split of Veuve! =) What a tasty treat to round out the experience.\n\n- They'll show you where they do the custom work, and their hardworking jewelry maker, an old school Italian craftsman.  The work they accomplish out of that space is nothing short of miraculous!\n\n- What's more, they're in the future! They've a 3D Printer that can create hard wax versions of your eventual ring, so that you can design the setting and ring exactly how you want. Because it's a 3D printer, they can reprint it and update your design as many times as necessary to get it precisely right for you. You will never, EVER walk out of this store with something that isn't absolutely perfect for you. It's amazing.\n\n- Their communication is bonkers amazing. *THAT* is a hard nut to crack in this day and age, because its so often we are lost, as consumers, to bad work flow, and forgetful employees.  Not here.... they are so transparent, througough, and expert communicators.\n\n- I am sure they've diamonds in stock, but do those diamonds speak to you? Probably not. They run the most informative and satisfying clinic on diamonds, their history, how they are rated, what cuts you might want, and what carats are right for you, and inform you of the in & out fashion trends.  It's fascinating how Instagram is informing the fads and trends of diamond interest.  Lucky my wifey is a trendsetter and outlier... she wanted a radiant cut, which isn't instagram hip as a cut right now, so it truly provided more bang for the buck.... more carats at less price than the other trendy cuts.

The walls seem to have no insulation, so you can hear clear conversations from the neighbor. So I suggest management to propose the owner to invest on insulation. My recommendation is for management/owner to invest on a onsite security personnel for maybe 6 months on and 6 months off so good residents like my nephew  feel safe to stay in this property. You can also be part of the Riverside Crime Free Multi housing. I did not see any signs on the property that shows you are part of this program.

We have really enjoyed how quiet and how pleasant the neighborhood is. We have easy access to all kinds of resources, grocery stores, shops, food and entertainment all within 5-15 minute drive. The price fits the complex, although the singular covered parking space included in the rent is a little unrealistic, especially for the people living in the two bedroom apts. Unless you work a super early or super late shift finding parking at peak times is extremely difficult, to the point where people block others in, park in fire lanes and generally are disruptive to others days. If you are okay with having to take some extra time to find parking or you only have one vehicle, this place is great!

I told him I could not afford to be running back and forth. His only response was that the insurance would not pay to have these tests done in one day. I knew then that it was all about the money only. There was no concern on the patients part. I asked what test I would need to gain clearance for hip surgery and told me I only need the Echo cardiogram test. As it were he was going to order all kinds of tests just to find something wrong with me. Why don't doctors find what's right and then build on that?

I'm so very thankful and appreciative. Homelessness is no joke and very depressing. I can breathe and live again and me and my 9 month old finally have a place to call our own. So thankful for wakeland for developing it and Saira, Jennifer and Nathaniel for all their hard work getting all these files processed. And I guess next week and throughout may 100 more units will be filled. Lol it's gonna get hectic as heck. Now there's only about 40 people, well 40 units occupied so it's quiet but when those next 100 units of probably average 100 to 300 people c come in haha no more calmness lol. But anyway very nice apartments. Color is earthy, light yellow walls and greenish brown tile flooring. NO carpet btw. And my kitchen is along side the wall but hey can't complain I have I FINALLY have a home.\n\nApril 2019 Update we have new management as of January 2019 manager came in and February 2019 assistant manager came in. They're Meh. You hardly ever see the manager which is bad. Deliberately avoids you on elevators. She didn't take the first elevator with me which is closest to staff parking anyway she walks to the double elevators. Um ok. Hardly see her anyway at least with Maeisha we saw them alot I kinda miss the old management. These are more by the book which is not always a bad thing. Just doesn't feel connecting like meesh and Jennifer were. See I even called her meesh :(\nLol. It is what it is.\n\nDec 3rd 2019 Edit again to say I notice many residents have multiple cars and I notice many residents have brand new Mercedes Benz range rovers trucks. The family that owns the Mercedes Benz I seen have the children's father show up and guess what he owns a Mercedes Benz as well. Like what the heck?? I thought this was a affordable housing complex for the lower income people. Those people don't deserve to live here and my sister came up with a good answer as to why they have all that is because they lied to get in this place they make more money than they are reporting. And that makes since and is not right for those of us who desperately need a place to live. Now this new management is by the book and on stuff so I'm sure they have a way of finding out. Otherwise if those people with the brand new range rovers and Mercedes Benz really are low income than their spending ALL they money on they car. A oil change alone for a range Rover I found from someone who owns it they said cost them $400-600 I said SAYYYY WHATTT!? just for one oil change you got to be joking. So anyhow there's no way the residents here are low income with cars like that that require such high maintenance. Again if they are all they money is going to they nice cars. To show off but live poor. Anyway that's my update again as a resident here. Also residents smoke when management is gone and on weekends. They also park in management parking after hours and on weekends as well LMAO what a way to really take advantage. And some may not know that the assistant manager and 2 maintenance men live at atmosphere as well. But I guess since it's after hours and weekends they are residents just like us and don't enforce or I could be wrong maybe they do but that they can't complain to everyone and also it's their time off to enjoy themselves. Anyhow I still think it's great place to live despite those that don't belong here. There's still ALOT of really cool people. Some who've I grown best friends with.\n\nWill update again if needed lol.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80d954a5e59f52e5:0x3a01bfa66f23f575"}

The classes I've taken are \"Yoga Sculpt\" and \"CorePower 2\".\n\nYoga Sculpt is like going through the yoga flow with weights, cardio, and strength training.  \"CorePower 2\" is the general Yoga class, but more demanding on the body than the previous level classes I assume. (Honestly I can't say since I haven't tried CorePower 1 or 1.5) Either way, both these classes will be as taxing on your body as you want it to be depending on how much you challenge yourself.\n\nThe instructors I've taken classes from are Jackie, Melanie, Roxy, and Kalista. The passion in their practice definitely shows in their classes. Each staff member is very inviting, encouraging during class, and will put you to work while at the same time being mindful of your body, mind, and spirit.\n\nLike I said, I'm no Yogi, but whether you're looking for a place to practice Yoga, or push your body's physical fitness level, CorePower Yoga at Golden Circle definitely delivers!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x808fc90cbcfb5737:0x53eff93976980632"}

He gave no receipt and even made a comment saying \"if you want to take me to court go for it\" PLEASE DON'T BRING YOUR CAR HERE. We waisted $380 and nothing got fixed.

He told me that he put the computer on it and it had all kinds of codes, he deleted them and got them back to what it supposed to be. And I haven't had any of the problems it was giving me. I say wow and shame on Galpin for all the money they took from me when all they had to do is change a code and tell me they changed a part or so.", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80c2be21df12c98f:0x5daa2095c47aeb16"}

With that said, I still ordered quite a few to try (not by myself, of course).I tried the spicy tuna (very good), salmon (very good), teriyaki chicken (not bad), and curry chicken( not bad).

We've been struggling with pool issues for over a year so I contacted Leslie's to request a service technician to check out our system.  First of all, Manager Paula is wonderful.  She's super nice and super helpful and always a pleasure to work with.  The Service Tech that came to our house, Mark, was just OUTSTANDING!  Mark took the time to listen carefully to our concerns and then made it totally clear that he fully understood what we have been frustrated with.  Then he reviewed our system and showed us exactly why we were having problems, fixed issues right there on the spot, showed us exactly what he did and explained to us exactly what we need to do in the future.  Mark was professional, friendly, caring and really just happy to help us.  It was an absolute pleasure to work with him and such a relief to finally have the knowledge and tools we need to keep our pool sparkling.  HUGE THANK YOU to Leslie's Pool Supplies, Service and Repair and their outstanding staff!\n\nNote - Issues we were having:\nPump and filtration system replaced 2 years ago and nothing but trouble since.  Black spot forming in pool.  We thought pump was too weak.  Tried several pool cleaning services, nothing getting better.\n\nMark showed us that our pump was actually much better and stronger than the original, issue was that it wasn't programmed properly and was only operating at about 65% of what the original pump operated at.  Mark reprogrammed the pump and showed us how we can reprogram as needed.  Also took care of a few other problems with our filtration system and identified the black spots as black algae and recommended a course of action that we're taking and all is looking up!", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x808529cac9ef7013:0xc05cdddb4fde7a62"}

Pautz did my Shattered elbow Surgery 2/2006 and then had to remove hardware in September 9/2006. I Thank Dr. Pautz in 2006/2007 for his amazing work & bedside manner. Then he disappeared...???... I heard awful rumors but when I saw his office next to Victorvalley Hospital...ALL I COULD DO WAS GET EXCITED TO FIND MY SURGEON !!!\nBut unfortunately 13 yrs later he told me I am as far as a surgeon can go...my extremel sharp stabbing pain that keeps me from working ,sleeping, & even doing basic duties around the house. I have never been able to brush my hair or put my hand behind my back since 2006 til last year with my amazing PT.\nMy only concern was that his solution was to insert a cortisone injection directly into my bone/elbow. I have nothing but bone on bone and that was the worst pain ever. I highly respect Dr. Pautz but when the words... \"If you can handle these cortisone injections then there is no need for you to see me as your elbow is fixed and you will endure pain for the rest of your life...due to the trauma at the area from the car accident...But I surgically can not help you so theres no need for a follow up\" Being He was the Doctor with all smiles & the greatest bedside manner....I guess 13 years can change a person. He no longer was that Doctor I was excited to see because everytime I had... he was there to help... It wasnt the reunion I had hoped for...even if there wasnt anything he could do. I WAS HIS PATIENT TWICE IN 2006 & I THANK HIM FOR ALL HE DID BACK THEN. NOW...??? Dr. Pautz I miss The smiles, Your amazing bedside manner, yes be truthful but now it's in a way I'm saying Not The Same Amazing Doctor.  If you still do wonders like you did with me... Then Welcome Back!!! For now I have orthopedics surgeons here & Loma Linda that ADDRESS the pain & issue... helping me atleast see PT to get my Daily functions back. I dont need meds... been dealing with it for 13+ yrs. But as a previous patient I GUESS I EXPECTED MORE...THAN A 'WELL I CANT HELP YOU\" We always want those that did the surgery to be in the loop of future care, plan of action.  I've fallen down the stairs twice, do heart & physical therapy,  pain management @ Loma Linda, and Spine specialist with my Orthopedic & Neurologist.\nYOU FIXED ME!!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a IM GRATEFUL\nMY 4 STARS IS BASED ON THE JOB YOU DID & YOU YOURSELF...5 I WOULD HAVE GIVEN... BUT MY RECENT FOLLOWUP IN 2015/2016 FELT LIKE A BRUSH OFF... VERY DISTURBING WHEN DR. PAUTZ IS WHO I SPOKE HIGHY ABOUT FOR YEARS... THOSE CURRENT VISITS I WAS SAD YOU HAD CHANGED.\nGOOD LUCK... IM SURE WE WILL CROSS PATHS AGAIN AS MY RECORDS ARE BEING LOOKED AT... AND THOSE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF ME NOW....KNOW OF YOU...\nTHANKS FOR THE 1-2 GOOD YEARS 2006/2007 ... \ud83d\ude91\ud83c\udfe5\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f\ud83e\uddb4\ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf89\u203c\n\u2796\ud83d\udc94\u26a0\ufe0f\ud83d\udc89\ud83e\uddb4\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2695\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udde3\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udde3\ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udc4b...", "pics": null, "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80c36440129b0c55:0x94d1998653c8f3e9"}

We are disappointed that our efforts to help you have left you with a bad impression.

After you called in November, about 4 months after your purchased your vehicle, and told us that your heater does not work, I asked you to bring it the following day. You said you would bring it on Monday. I said ok. You mentioned your A/C did not work from the day you bought it, which was in August, about 105 degree plus. When you called three weeks later we just said if you can not make it please let us know because the parts we purchase have a time limited replacement warranty and we do not want the warranty from manufacturer expire. By the way we do have a receipt that we put in new A/C compressor prior to you purchasing it. We assumed it was working since summer is gone and no complaints from you at that time. Without hesitation we said bring the car to fix. you got upset and we think maybe you thought we said no warranty or warranty expired whereas we were talking about the A/C compressor that we put on. You hung up and we called back right away and no answer. Asked Jonathan to call you since he was your rep and he said no answer either. We have the text that was sent right away by Jonathan asking you to come in, but you did not respond to any of our calls. It would be easier if you would answer our calls and get it resolved and repaired as we do for all our customers. Please contact us and lets get this issue fixed.

I told her I already waited in line, im not going outside to keep checking &moving about for cell service..Then the bigger FAT heavy lady chimed in stating they cudnt help me because I started my registration on line.. I'm going back in  fourth wit these f'n clowns over sum damn cell service ..finally after all that, the price quoted for my rental total was not the price showing up on the signature screen & Ajoy was unable to explain the huge difference in price to hold on my credit card & instructs me to sign the electronic rental agreement with the different quoted price! Then Ajoy tells me the electronic screen sum times freezes on the previous transaction, im thinkn by this point is she serious?? I asked this chic, so u want me to sign a rental agreement for sumone else's transaction?? Ajoy tells me that its not going to charge my card, jus hold the amount..I REFUSED to sign the electronic rental agreement with the incorrect quoted price. After she saw I wasnt budging or leaving without that truck, she printed out a hard copy rental agreement with the correct quoted price..I have no idea, why this chic was trying top get me to sign the wrong quote for a hold.. & it seems they gave me the most BEATup truck on the lot.. Ajoy &the huge FAT chic had the nerve to try & intimidate me in buying the f'n insurance..telling me they dont bill third  parties for damages..I dont giv a rats azz!that truck had soo many dents, scratches, scuffs throughout the entire outside body of the truck..I did my walk around inspection & documented all of it!...the inside cabin was not clean, there was ketchup on the cup  holders & front dash area.

The trail wasn\u2019t too steep and I was able to keep a brisk pace even with the snow. About half a mile in, I hit the paved road that leads to the lookout, and took that for maybe a mile. This was again a very easy and gradual incline (I think it\u2019s only a ~500 ft elevation gain the whole hike). The road was wide, and very quickly I reached the top of the mountain. The signs ask you not to go up the road to the helipad, so follow the signs down and around, then back up to the lookout tower. From there, there\u2019s a great 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains. I would have loved to stay and watch the sun set from the tower, but because of coronavirus and the current restrictions, you have to be out of the park by 5pm. Since this is a helipad and fire lookout tower, there are a lot of towers, wires, satellite things, etc that can get in the way, so be sure to walk around the entire area to really take in all the scenery. I enjoyed going in winter as this already isn\u2019t a common hike in Yosemite, but other people were few and far between, so it was very peaceful and relaxing of a hike, and a great start to 2021", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS9fnAZgqBA6oyNU5AoOk_ZGAvNQERD7wSPoJ7=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNztaYRLGROYgnuLxMTTQ9yHGvNMKbJ5lBqGqy_=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzeBZYm606JW5SQ84yL8AssBvpPx_SzWjrR6C8=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmdU85Bkt4IBE-LYAROAEAM7Qgg54O5YS_YHzZ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-JeHl0i-ExQLZ1oEzam01QuVUkHMM1edX4WZ-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x8096c2cdaca3e23b:0xf9587931663cfe18"}

Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention as we do not want any guest to feel neglected. We are also sorry that no one helped you get a box and that you had to get it. This is unacceptable and we will be going over this in our next training. We hope to show you we care and would like to better understand more about your recent visit. If you would be able to share the day/time of your visit so we can share your experience with our team, this will help us make adjustments where necessary.\u00a0 Please email us at reviews@brokenyolkcafe.com so we can better understand what went wrong and work towards making things right. We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you."}, "gmap_id": "0x80dd2bc1dfc5d745:0x8432f4160c2da79c"}

They are fantastic to work with and I am so happy we discovered them.\n\nAs we approached a milestone anniversary,  we were looking at options to enhance my wedding set.  We took my ring to Zales for a repair and while we waited for the estimate, we browsed the cases.  We explained to the salesperson the desire to enhance my ring and we were frustrated that the visit ended with the repair bill exceeding $800 and the salesperson trying to talk us into trading in my wedding to upgrade to a new set. Thankfully we ended up at Michael's Jewelers. The repair to my ring was less than $75 and Victoria spent lots of time helping me design a perfect ring to enhance my current wedding set, without changing my original set. She is extremely knowledgeable and offered some great advice. The finished product was more perfect than I ever imagined.\n\nAfter our success with my ring, we turned to Victoria to help my son create a beautiful wedding ring out of one of my earrings. She helped capture all of his \"wants\" and the end product was stunning.\n\nTheir prices are reasonable and the quality is superb. We have purchased items, designed jewelry with them, trusted them with our repairs, and plenty of rings cleaned there.  I highly recommend Michael's Jewelers for all of your jewelry needs.", "pics": [{"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBYoUp4q4Zk_iLT5kGteWOsYMzsXPKsIM_0ov3=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9KHiVKA-FOjxdPS9s6oVvBFSmN0ijBNa9fyHW=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNupKr_UJAJHodg13QKtb5i3p4jy-UekxE5hNSa=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc4bgUSc1NgZmSULYmWDwdgY90ftewd2wtcpD3=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3sR86-DYKKQjE3uyMIjA_PvbMQDZ-y1_2M_C1=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMntaBWnpwx1DB4fCLTzbeOUXYhbcgvH2eobvxf=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQrsc8p5Iaew_cE8z2iWpTXvBEeJfh-jFOl6bL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}, {"url": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDtAck0Uvv-dPE26eMFuT0C0VDtD7xP2bTB5eN=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}], "resp": null, "gmap_id": "0x80d957ffcdee700d:0x1e0dca79c18fdcb5"}

I ordered Take-Out style, but I was told they also can send a taquero to your event.\n\nWe ordered adobada, carne asada, pollo asado, shrimp, and veggie, and we got a 5 gallon jug of horchata. Everything was absolutely delicious and perfectly seasoned/marinated, but my personal favorite was by far the adobada, which was cooked to perfection (I feel like many places overcook it). The salsas were also great: it came with pico de gallo, salsa roja, salsa de chipotle, and a mild salsa. Beans, rice, guacamole, and fresh corn tortillas as well.\n\nYou can be sure that we'll be ordering from El Guero 2 for plenty more of our events!
